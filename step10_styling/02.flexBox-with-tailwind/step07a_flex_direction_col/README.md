# Flex Direction Column with Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS

We will learn Flex Direction with CSS Flex using Tailwind CSS from this [CSS Flex and Grid book](https://shrutibalasa.gumroad.com/l/css-flex-and-grid).

The first thing we learnt here was that adding flex utility makes all the child elements get
laid out in one direction. By default they all get placed in a single row. To change that row
direction to a column instead, we can use the flex-col utility along with flex .

Start by reading pages 40 to 43 and build the [Welcome Screen 5a](https://play.tailwindcss.com/evRPFKUqeI?size=550x630)

Update app/globals.css, app/page.tsx, and tailwind.config.js
