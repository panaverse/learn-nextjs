# Flex Wrap with Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS

We will learn Flex Wrap with CSS Flex using Tailwind CSS from this [CSS Flex and Grid book](https://shrutibalasa.gumroad.com/l/css-flex-and-grid).

The flex-wrap utility class makes the flex items wrap if you run out of space. The default behaviour is to not wrap, which is why the child items do not move into the next row automatically.
