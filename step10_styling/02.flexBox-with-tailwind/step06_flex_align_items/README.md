# Align Items with Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS

We will learn Align Items with CSS Flex using Tailwind CSS from this [CSS Flex and Grid book](https://shrutibalasa.gumroad.com/l/css-flex-and-grid) page 33 and 34.

The justify-* utilities allow us to control the spacing and alignment of the flex items in
the direction they are placed (Horizontally in all our previous examples). While items-*
utilities allow us to control the alignment in its perpendicular direction.

Start by reading page 33 and 34 and build the [Understanding Align Items](https://play.tailwindcss.com/epBJLBpXkB?size=1100x530)

Update app/globals.css and app/page.tsx
