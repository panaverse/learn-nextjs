# Sample Hardhat Project

1. bool has 2 possible values that is true and false.
Operators that can be used on bool:
1. !(logical negation)
2. &&(logical conjuction AND)
3. ||(logical disconjuction OR)
4. ==(equality)
5. !=(inequality)
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
