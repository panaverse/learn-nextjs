# Sample Hardhat Project

Constructor only executed once
You can create only one constructor and that is optional
A default constructor is created by compiler if there is no explicitly defined constructor.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:


```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
