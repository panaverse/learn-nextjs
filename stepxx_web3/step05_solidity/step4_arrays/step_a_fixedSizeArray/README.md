# Sample Hardhat Project

There are two types of Arrays: Fixed Size Array and Dynamic Size Array
Fixed Size Array: At compile time we know the length of an array.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
