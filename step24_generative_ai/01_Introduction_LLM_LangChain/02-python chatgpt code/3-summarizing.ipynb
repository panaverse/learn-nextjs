Overall if you can get this one \\\n","around the $50 mark, it's a good deal.

And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \\\n","so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \\\n","So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \\\n","where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \\\n","as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \\\n","plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \\\n","very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\ \n","blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \\\n","I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \\\n","blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \\\n","first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \\\n","if I need them finer/less pulpy).
