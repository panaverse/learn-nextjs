# Generative AI Definition

Generative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence, refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating, generating, or producing data, content, or outputs that are not explicitly programmed. It involves using machine learning algorithms and models to generate new information, images, text, or other forms of content based on patterns and examples from existing data.

Generative AI can be used in a wide range of applications, and it has the potential to revolutionize various industries. Below are some real-world applications of Generative AI:
