# Parallel Routing with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications that support server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing. In this chapter, we will explore one of the advanced features of Next.js: parallel routing.

Parallel routing allows you to render more than one page in the same view, such as complex dashboards or modals. With parallel routing, you can simultaneously render one or more pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. This gives you more flexibility and control over how you display your content and enhance the user experience.

To use parallel routing, you need to follow a special convention for naming your files and folders. You need to use the `@` symbol to indicate a slot, which is a named prop that can be passed to a layout component. A slot is not a route segment and does not affect the URL structure. For example, if you have a file named `@team/members.tsx`, it means that the `team` slot will receive the `members` component as a prop. You can have multiple slots in the same level, and they will be rendered in parallel. For example, the file path `/@team/members` would be accessible at `/members`.

To render the slots, you need to have a layout component that accepts the slot props and renders them accordingly. The layout component can use some hooks to access the active route segments within each slot. For example, you can use a hook to render the `team` and `analytics` slots in your layout, and show or hide them based on the presence of the corresponding segments. You can also use another hook to access all the segments within a slot as an array. For example, you can use this array to render a breadcrumb that shows the current navigation path within the slot.

Parallel routing can be used to implement various complex routing patterns, such as modals, conditional routes, or nested layouts. For example, you can use parallel routing to render a modal that can be shown by navigating to a matching route, such as `/login`. You can define a slot named `@auth` that renders a `<Modal>` component, and pass it to the layout component as a prop. Then, you can create a file named `@auth/login.tsx` that defines the login component, and wrap it with the `<Modal>` component. Now, when you navigate to `/login`, the login modal will be rendered on top of the current view, and you can dismiss it by navigating away from the route.

Parallel routing is a powerful feature that enables you to create more dynamic and interactive web applications with Next.js. By using the `@` convention and the layout hooks, you can render multiple pages in the same view that can be navigated independently. This gives you more flexibility and control over how you display your content and enhance the user experience.
